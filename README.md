# pkgbuild-introspection

This is a suite of tools which can be used to parse PKGBUILDs and create
SRCINFO files. Most users will only be interested in the `mkaurball` utility
which generates tarballs suitable for submission to Arch Linux's
[AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org). The remainder of these tools are intended for
development and debugging purposes.
